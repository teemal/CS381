# CS381
## This repo contains implementations of a Sieve of Eratosthenes, an algorithm to find prime numbers up to N. One in C, one in ML, and one in Elixir.

### To run:
1. Clone repo

### C:
1. `cd to/C/directory`
2. run `make`
3. run `./primesMT` + `-t num_threads -u upper_bound` were num_threads is the number of threads you want to dedicate and upper_bound is the highest possible prime to find

### Elixir
1. `cd to/Elixir/directory`
2. run `elixir primesMT.ex` and follow prompt

### ML
//TODO
